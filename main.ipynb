    "* You will provide a .py or .ipynb file; __it is critical that the code runs__ (i.e. if I press the \"Run\" button there should be no error message) - if it does not, you will lose most of the grade\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you do not know how to answer a question, just skip it or write something simple that works (even if uncomplete), but please do not leave a piece of code that breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "* You do not need to write text, just code; please `print` important results (otherwise they are executed but do not get printed)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doing the assignments in groups is strongly recommended; please do not copy among different groups: if I detect errors that have been copy pasted and that are suspiciously similar across different submission the grade will be penalized\n",
    "\n",
    "* Just send one submission per group includind the names of the memembers\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may use whatever IDE you want (VSCode, Replit, or GitHub Codespaces), but the submission of the file must be done through __Turnitin__ in Blackboard\n",
    "\n",
    "* When I ask you to \"comment\" on something, just write one or two concise lines, and actually comment the lines (prepend a # symbol); please be crisp and avoid long paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are several ways to do something, or the instructions are open-ended, please use your freedom; __creativity will receive bonus points__"
